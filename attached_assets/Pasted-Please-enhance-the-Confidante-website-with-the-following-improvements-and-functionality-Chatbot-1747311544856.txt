Please enhance the Confidante website with the following improvements and functionality:

💬 Chatbot Improvements:

Enhance the chatbot’s design to match the soft, health-focused theme of the site.

Use a round floating icon that expands into a friendly, smooth chat interface.

Style the bot to feel human-centered and welcoming (e.g., soft blue background, rounded message bubbles).

Add smart greeting behavior: show a welcome message when the page loads and suggest helpful topics like “Learn about our programs,” “Talk to a specialist,” etc.

Keep the chatbot fixed to the bottom right of the page on both desktop and mobile.

🚀 "Get Started" Button (Scroll Functionality):

Add a “Get Started” button in both the navigation bar and the hero section.

Both buttons should implement smooth scroll behavior to the Latest Insights section.

Use a scroll animation (ease-in-out, 800ms) and visually highlight the section when scrolled into view.

🔗 Navigation Scroll Behavior:

Update the navigation links for smooth scroll functionality:

Home → scrolls to the Hero Section

Insights → scrolls to the Latest Insights section

Use smooth scrolling and active section highlighting as users navigate.

Add a small animation (e.g., underline grow or color fade) to show the active link.

🖼️ Logo Update (Not Theme):

Replace the existing logo with the one I’ve uploaded.

Ensure the logo fits naturally in the navigation pane on both desktop and mobile.

Do not change the theme; only update the logo image and adjust spacing or size if necessary for visual balance.

💡 Services Section Buttons:

Add working functionality to the “Learn More” and “Request Info” buttons under the Our Services section:

“Learn More” → Scrolls or opens a modal with additional details about the specific service.

“Request Info” → Opens a contact form or scrolls to the contact section where users can submit a message.

Include hover animations and transitions to enhance interaction feedback.

🌐 General UI Consistency:

Ensure all updates follow the existing design language: soft color palette, rounded corners, smooth animations, and responsive layout.

Keep performance optimized and maintain accessibility best practices (focus outlines, alt texts, proper contrast).
